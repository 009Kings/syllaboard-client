# Syllaboard
A dashboard for instructors at GA.
Immersive courses are just that: immersive. When you have multiple things going on, it can be easy to let somethings slip through the cracks: laundry, personal care, and more often than not, the outcomes homework that is also a part of the course. This webapp aims to help both the outcomes instructors and the students to stay organised and on-top of the work.
